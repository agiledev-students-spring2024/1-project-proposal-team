# Project Proposal
### Project title

Easy Data Visualization

### What and why?

I'd like to a build a web-app that provides users a super basic data management/data analysis based on data provided by the user. The web-app should be extremely user-friendly and provide rudimentary data analysis for users who don't have a basic programming background. 

More often than not, I've seen my friends and family have to learn excel and other data management tools despite entering fields you wouldn't expect that skill to be necessary. I want to create a tool that helps users fill in the gaps in their knowledge by abstracting the technical skill necessary to use excel and other data management tools.

### For whom?

I imagine this tool to be first and foremost for business students, business people, and users who think they need to take excel courses/obtain an excel certificate. I believe this tool could also be used by data scientists who would like quick solutions.

### How?

The web-app will provide the end-user an intuitive GUI with options to input data, view the data, and perform quick actions on the data (whether it be to visualize, clean up, sum, etc.). The users will then be able to save and download the output of the web-app.

### Scope

I believe a team of 4-6 students will be able to create a user-friendly web-app that can handle rudimentary actions on data. In order to deliver a strong product, I think the team should focus on implementing and refining only a handful of basic actions that can be performed on the data rather than trying to deliver something on the scale of what a company can do.
